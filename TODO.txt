- write a decent readme
- stop using an unreleased escort that points at filesystem
- try it out when installing at the top level
- try it out with binstubs in another project
- think about if it needs any arguments at all

- ppjson --file - to read json from a file, format it and spit it out to STDOUT
- ppjson --file --inline - to read json from a file, format it and overwrite the file with it
- ppjson --file --backwards - take json from file which is presumably pretty already and unprettify it
